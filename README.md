### How to start a game?
> You should pull this repo to your local machine, and compile the **main.cpp** file. After that, you could double click the **main.exe** (or whatever name you give to it) to start running.

### How to use files as user input?
> By default, we use the text files in the subfolder named **solve** as the file input. However, you can use text files wherever they are located, as long as you specify the path to the file when you choose to input via files.
